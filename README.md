### Italians do it better - than trolls!

# Abstract
The phenomenon of Russian trolls has taken centre stage in the last months, casting a shadow on our understanding of the mechanisms which move social network discussions and debates in general. Somehow, it is easy to get the impression that we are being manipulated by some entity trying to impose a certain mindset and political climate of division. What citizens would ideally aim to, instead, is to take independent and informed decisions which are not spurred by heated online debates encouraged by Russian agencies. This is particularly relevant to us as two of our team members come from Italy, a country which has allegedly been heavily influenced by Russian trolls during the 2018 general elections. 

While most of the research until now has focused on the role of IRA by considering the US tweets, we want to draw attention on the characteristics of the Italian tweets. Our analysis explores the characteristics of the IRA twitter authors and the features of their tweets. We want to gain insight on how the IRA operated and thus look for textual patterns, time development and topic distributions and places of interests. 

We claim that it is possible to witness a strategy implemented by IRA to highlight the weaknesses of the Italian system and stimulate divisiveness within the society.

# Research questions
1.	How are the tweet authors distributed in terms on number of accounts followed and followers? What is their level of daily activity?<br />
    We see that there is a tendency to diverisfy large and small accounts.
2.  Is there an interest on Italian politics? How is activity of the leaders of the main political parties covered?<br />
    We see that the leader of the centre-left party is the subject of more tweets than are the leaders of populist parties. However, the difference is not large considering that he was Prime Minister during the publication of the tweets. In general all parties considered are shown to receive a similar number of criticisms and comments, although the Democrats seem to be a bit penalised and populist parties also receive some consensus.
3.	Is there an interest on some Italian regions? <br />
    We see that the regions of Southern Italy, who suffer more socio-economic problems and were key in contributing to the election of the populist parties, are the subject of a high number of tweets considering their smaller population. In addition, mention to places often reflects key interests of the local reality: mainly immigration in the North and social problems in the South.
4.	Is there an explanation for the oscillating number of tweets produced by trolls in different times? <br />
    We see that tweets are more frequent in moments coinciding with: migratory crisis, terrorists attacks and significant political events for the country.
5.	Are there main topics treated by trolls? Is it possible to connect them to the main points of the  programmes of the populist parties? Is it possible to capture the presence of words often appearing together? <br />
    While tweets cover a broad range of topics, the main interest of trolls is on politics and on themes which reflect contemporary issues and are relevant to the Italian public: namely, migration, terrorism and political scandals. In addition, tweets turn out to be partinioned in groups based on their topic by means of clustering.
6.  What is the general sentiment of the tweets? <br />
    While topics covered are mostly negative (terror attacks, crisis, scandals...) it is not possible to find a prevalent sentiment in the tweets and even different political parties share the same sentiment levels.

# Dataset
+ The key points of our analysis will be derived from the IRA dataset. In particular, we exploit both the earlier version and the updated one. We select tweets in Italian, excluding the other ones for the main analysis.

+ For Italian socio-economic data the main reference was ISTAT, the National Institute of Statistics.

+ YouTrend provided data for the results of the 2018 General Elections in Italy.

+ Economic indicators for some European countries (debt/GDP) were retrieved from the IMF.
