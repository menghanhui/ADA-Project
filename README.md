# Title

# Abstract
The phenomenon of Russian trolls has taken centre stage in the last months, casting a shadow on our understanding of the mechanisms which move social network discussions and debates in general. Somehow, it is easy to get the impression that we are being manipulated by some entity trying to impose a certain mindset and political climate of division. What citizens would ideally aim to, instead, is to take independent and informed decisions which are not spurred by heated online debates encouraged by Russian agencies. This is particularly relevant to us as two of our team members come from Italy, a country which has allegedly been heavily influenced by Russian trolls during the 2018 general elections. 
While most of the research until now has focused on the role of IRA by considering the US tweets, we want to draw attention on the characteristics of the Italian tweets. Our analysis explores the characteristics of the IRA twitter authors and the features of their tweets. We want to gain insight on how the IRA operated and thus look for textual patterns, time development and topic distributions and places of interests. 
We claim that it is possible to witness a strategy implemented by IRA to highlight the weaknesses of the Italian system and stimulate divisiveness within the society.
Lastly, we evaluate relevant differences and similarities between US and Italian troll tweets.

# Research questions
1.	How are the tweet authors distributed in terms on number of accounts followed and followers? What is their level of daily activity?
    We see that there is a tendency to diverisfy large and small accounts.
2.  Is there an interest on Italian politics? How is activity of the leaders of the main political parties covered?
    We see that the leader of the centre-left party, is the subject of more tweets than are the leaders of populist parties. However, the difference is not large considering that he was Prime Minister during the publication of the tweets.
2.	Is there an interest on some Italian regions? 
    We see that the regions of Southern Italy, who suffer more socio-economic problems and were key in contributing to the election of the populist parties, are the subject of a high number of tweets considering their smaller population.
3.	Is there an explanation for the oscillating number of tweets produced by trolls in different times?
    We see that tweets are more frequent in three cases: migratory crisis, terrorists attacks and significant political moments for the country.
4.	Are there main topics treated by trolls? Is it possible to connect them to the main points of the  programmes of the populist parties? Is it possible to capture the presence of words often appearing together? How do these compare with the activity of trolls in the US?
5.	Is there a structure on the relationships between troll authors? Is it possible to construct a meaningful network of this?

# Dataset
The key points of our analysis will be derived from the IRA dataset. In particular, we exploit both the earlier version and the updated one. We select tweets in Italian, excluding the other ones for the main analysis.
US tweets are used in order to establish differences between the strategy of the trolls in the US and in Italy.
Further sources of information might come from Google trends, especially for what concerns interest on topics or political parties and leaders.
This could be done using information we have for each tweet: content, author, region, language, number of following and followers.

# Questions for TAa
1. We would like to display the Italian map, and achieve something like we did in HW2 for Switzerland. Any sugestion on where to find similar geojson files for Italy?
2. How could we adjust our project direction to make the result aim closer at "social good"?
